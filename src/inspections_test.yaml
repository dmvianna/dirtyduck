# If you want to only include rows in your matrices in a specific state,
# provide:

#   should have columns entity_id/state/start/end
# 2. a list of state filtering SQL clauses to iterate through. Assuming the
#   states are boolean columns (the experiment will convert the one you pass in
#   to this format), write a SQL expression for each state
#   configuration you want, ie '(permitted OR suspended) AND licensed'

# USER METADATA
# These are arbitrary keys/values that you can have Triage apply to the
# metadata for every matrix in the experiment. Any keys you include here can
# be used in the 'model_group_keys' below. For example, if you run experiments
# that share a temporal configuration but that use different label definitions
# (say, labeling building inspections with *any* violation as positive or
# labeling only building inspections with severe health and safety violations
# as positive), you can use the user metadata keys to indicate that the matrices
# from these experiments have different labeling criteria. The matrices from the
# two experiments will have different filenames (and not be overwritten or
# inappropriately reused), and if you add the label_definition key to the model
# group keys, models made on different label definition will have different
# groups. In this way, user metadata can be used to expand Triage beyond its
# explicitly supported functionality.
