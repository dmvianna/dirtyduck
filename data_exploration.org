** Loading data to the database
   Assuming that you are already inside =bastion=, run the following

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/ :results raw drawer
     psql ${FOOD_DB_URL} -c 'select count(*) from raw.inspections'
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   :RESULTS:
    count
   -------
        0
   (1 row)

   :END:

   (If you are connected to the database, you could just type =select count(*) from raw.inspections=

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/
     psql ${FOOD_DB_URL} -c "\copy raw.inspections FROM '/data/inspections.csv' WITH HEADER CSV"
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : COPY 162753


   This is different to the number of rows that we calculated
   previously. The reason is that the columns =violations= contains
   several lines in some examples. But don't worry, the previous
   command took care about that.

   Let's glimpse the data

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/ :results org drawer
     psql ${FOOD_DB_URL} -c 'select * from raw.inspections limit 5'
   #+END_SRC

   Checking the documentation (located  [[https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/assets/BAD5301B-681A-4202-9D25-51B2CAE672FF?download=true][here]]),

   The meaning of some columns is the following:

   - Risk category of facility:: Each establishment is categorized as
     to its risk of adversely affecting the public’s health, with 1
     being the highest and 3 the lowest. The frequency of
     inspection is tied to this risk, with risk 1 establishments
     inspected most frequently and risk 3 least frequently.

   - Inspection type:: An inspection can be one of the following
     types: canvass, the most common type of inspection performed
     at a frequency relative to the risk of the   establishment;
     consultation, when the inspection is  done at the request of the
     owner prior to the opening of the establishment; complaint, when
     the inspection is done in    response to a complaint against the
     establishment; license, when the inspection is done    as a
     requirement for the establishment to receive its license to
     operate; suspect food    poisoning, when the inspection is done
     in response to one or more persons claiming to    have gotten ill
     as a result of eating at the establishment (a specific type of
     complaint-   based inspection); task-force inspection, when an
     inspection of a bar or tavern is done.    Re-inspections can
     occur for most types of these inspections and are indicated as
     such.

   -  Results:: An inspection can pass, pass with conditions or
     fail. Establishments receiving a ‘pass’ were found to have no
     critical or serious violations (violation number 1-14 and 15-29,
     respectively). Establishments receiving a ‘pass  with conditions’
     were found to have critical or serious violations, but these were
     corrected during the inspection. Establishments receiving a
     ‘fail’ were found to have critical or serious violations that
     were not correctable during the inspection. An establishment
     receiving a ‘fail’ does not  necessarily mean the establishment’s
     licensed is suspended. Establishments found to be out of business
     or not located are indicated as such.

   - Violations: An establishment can receive one or more of 45
     distinct violations (violation numbers 1-44 and 70). For each
     violation number listed for a given establishment, the
     requirement the establishment must meet in order for it to NOT
     receive a violation is noted, followed by a specific description
     of the findings that caused the violation to be issued.


   From this definitions, we can deduct the following claims:

1. /risk/ is related to the frequency of inspections of type /canvass/.
2. /consultation/ is a compulsory inspections /before/ the facility opens
   (so we can remove it from the data), the same happens with /license/.
3. /complaint/ and /suspect food poisoning/ inspections are triggered by
   the people, /consultation/ is triggered by the owner of the
   facility.
4. /task-force/ occurs against bar or taverns.
5. *Critical violations* are coded between =1-14=, *serious violations*
   between =15-29=. So, we can assume that the violations code =30= and
   onward are /minor/ violations.
6. They are only three possible results of the inspection (plus the
   fact that the facility was not located or out of business).


Let's check that we have *only* three different classifications for the
=risk= of the facility:


#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select risk, count(*) from raw.inspections group by risk order by count(*) desc
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| risk            |  count |
|-----------------+--------|
| Risk 1 (High)   | 113873 |
| Risk 2 (Medium) |  33625 |
| Risk 3 (Low)    |  15167 |
| [NULL]          |     66 |
| All             |     22 |
:END:

Ok, two more: =All= and =NULL= for a grand total of *5*. What about =types= of inspections?

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select count(distinct type) from raw.inspections
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| count |
|-------|
|   108 |
:END:

Wow, we got *108* types of inspections instead of *5*.

Which are those types? How bad is it?

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select type, count(*) from raw.inspections group by type order by count(*) desc limit 50
#+END_SRC

Ok, disheartening. But, that is the reality of /real/ data. In the next
section we will try to clean this mess.


** Transforming (and cleaning) the data

   For tackling a Machine Learning problem you need to identify the
   *entities* of your problem domain, and if your problem involves time,
   how those entities change over time, i.e. which *events* happened to
   that entity or which *events* where acted by the entity in question.

   We will materialize that in two different tables, one for entities and
   one for events, we will name those as =entities= and =events= respectively.

The entity is the *facility*, and the events that happen to that entity
are the *inspections*.

The table =entities= should contain an unique identifier for the entity,
some data specific for that entity (like name, age, status). The
=events= table will include data related to the description of the inspection.

Before starting the cleaning, you should know one of the golden rules
-that will make your life easier:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
   /You can't change your original data/
#+END_QUOTE

The reason for this is, if you make some mistake, or if you want to
try a different thing you will always can go back to the beginning and
start over.

Let's see the data to figure out how we need to be transform it. We
will concentrate at first in all columns except =violations=, we will
deal with that later, since is more complex.


First, we will remove superfluous spaces and will transform the columns
=type,results, dba_name, aka_name, facility_type, address, city= to
lower case, also, we will clean =risk= keeping only the description
(e.g. *high*).


We still need to clean the column =type= (it contains several more
variations instead of the *seven* mentioned in the documentation:
/canvass/, /complaint/, /license/, /re-inspection/, /task-force/, /consultation/
and /suspect food poisoning/). For simplicity, we will use /regular
expressions/ and we will ignore /re-inspection/.

For the column =risk= , we will impute as =high= all the =NULL= and =All=
values.

As we have seen (and we will continue see that)  through all this
tutorial, /data is always messy/, to
begin with we have several different spellings (e.g. =SUBWAY= and
=Subway=, =MCDONALDS= and =MC DONALD'S=, =DUNKIN DONUTS/BASKIN ROBBINS= and
=DUNKIN DONUTS / BASKIN ROBBINS=, etc)

We could try a very simple cleaning for example, convert all the
names to uppercase, remove the trailing spaces, remove the apostrophe
"='"= and remove the spaces around "=/=". The problem with this approach
is that we will be fixing the names that we just saw, but there are
several other nuances down that list. Another approach is use [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/fuzzystrmatch.html][soundex]],
but that will create a lot of mismatches. The real workaround is apply
some /machine learning/ to /deduplicate/ the entities [fn:3].  We wont
follow that path here.

Let's move to the spatial columns (=state, city, zip, latitude,
longitude=).

All the rows in the data should be from Ilinois, let's check that

#+begin_src sql
select state, count(*) from raw.inspections group by state
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| state  |  count |
|--------+--------|
| [NULL] |     20 |
| IL     | 162733 |
:END:

Ok, almost, We will assume that the =NULL= values are actually =IL=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select city, count(*) from raw.inspections group by city order by count(*) desc limit 10
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| city              |  count |
|-------------------+--------|
| CHICAGO           | 162029 |
| Chicago           |    264 |
| [NULL]            |    144 |
| chicago           |     80 |
| CCHICAGO          |     41 |
| SCHAUMBURG        |     20 |
| MAYWOOD           |     15 |
| ELK GROVE VILLAGE |     12 |
| CHicago           |     11 |
| EVANSTON          |      8 |
:END:

There are 144 rows with =NULL= values and 41 rows with =CCHICAGO=, we will
fix this to problems with the value =chicago=.

The zip code has a similar problem:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select count(*) from raw.inspections where zip is null or btrim(zip) = ''
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| count |
|-------|
|    71 |
:END:

We could attempt to remove this =NULLs= using the location point or
using similar names of restaurants, but for this tutorial we will
remove this.

Continuing with the cleaning, we will drop the columns =state=,
=latitude=, =longitude=, since these are (now) redundant. We will remove
the column =city= since almost everything happens in Chicago (this is
the Chicago's food inspection data set anyway).

We will convert the coordinates latitude and longitude to a =Point=.

As a final step in the cleaning we will change the name of the columns
for explicit or better names(e.g =results -> result, dba_name -> facility=, etc).

We will create a new =schema= called =cleaned=. The objective of this
schema is twofold: keep our raw data as-is and store our assumptions
and cleaning decisions separated from the raw in a schema that
/semantically/ is transmitting the information: "this is our clean
data".


#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle ./src/create_cleaned_inspections_table.sql
  create schema if not exists cleaned
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Then, we will create our mini *ETL* with our cleaning decisions:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :tangle ./src/create_cleaned_inspections_table.sql
drop table if exists cleaned.inspections cascade;

create table cleaned.inspections as (
with cleaned as (
select
inspection,
btrim(lower(results)) as result,
license_num,
btrim(lower(dba_name)) as facility,
btrim(lower(aka_name)) as facility_aka,
btrim(lower(facility_type)) as facility_type,
lower(substring(risk from '\((.+)\)')) as risk,
btrim(lower(address)) as address,
zip as zip_code,
substring(btrim(lower(regexp_replace(type, 'liquor', 'task force', 'gi'))) from 'canvass|task force|complaint|food poisoning|consultation|license|tag removal') as type,
date,
ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326) as location
from raw.inspections
where zip is not null
)

select * from cleaned where type is not null
);
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:


You could execute this code using (if you are not connected to the database):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /docker:root@tutorial_bastion:/ :results org drawer
psql ${FOOD_DB_URL} < /code/create_cleaned_inspections_table.sql
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
SELECT 162682
:END:

Or, if you are connected to the database

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE sql
\i /code/create_cleaned_inspections_table.sql
#+END_EXAMPLE


#+BEGIN_SRC sql :results table
 select count(inspection) from cleaned.inspections;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
|  count |
|--------|
| 162682 |
:END:


Let's look closer the column =violations=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
select violations from raw.inspections limit 5
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
| violations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                        |

   - If there are several violations reported, those violations will
     be separated by ='|'=
   - Every violation begins with a code and  a description
   - Every violation could have *comments*, those comments appear after
     the string =- Comments:=

We will take that observations in account and create a new table
called =cleaned.violations= to store

#+RESULTS:

This code is in =/code/create_violations_table.sql=, you can execute
this as before.

If everything worked correctly you should be able to run the following code:


#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  select
  case when grouping(severity) = 1 then 'TOTAL' else severity end as severity,
  count(*) from cleaned.violations
  group by rollup (severity)
#+END_SRC

| minor    | 479835 |
| serious  |  77400 |
| [NULL]   |  12701 |
| TOTAL    | 608168 |
:END:

As a last step, we should create from the cleaned tables the =entities=
and =events= table.

** Entities table

The =entities= table should uniquely identify the entities and contain
the attributes that describes the entity.

We could hope that =license_num= is the way to go for uniquely
identify the facility, let's confirm this with some queries.

We will beging with the following query:
 /What are the top 5 licenses with more inspections?/

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
    select
    license_num, count(*) as total_inspections,
    coalesce(count(*) filter (where result = 'fail'), 0)
    as total_failures
    from cleaned.inspections
    group by license_num
    order by total_inspections desc
    limit 5;
#+END_SRC

This looks weird, let's investigate a little about
the =license_num= = =0=.

  coalesce(count(*) filter (where result = 'fail'), 0)

Most of these are related to /special events/, /churchs/, /festivals/
etc. We could research deeply the =restaurants= which have =license_num= =
=0=, but we will skip that for the moment.

We conclude that we can't use the =license_num= as the unique
identifier.

If we go back to the columns of the table, we could try with the
column =license_num=  (assume that one license represents one
establishment) and the column =address= (assume that one restaurant is
in one place).

#+BEGIN_SRC sql

  count(distinct license_num) as total_licenses,
  count(distinct facility) as total_facilities,
  count(distinct address) as total_addresses

:END:

We were expecting (naively) that we should get 1 =license_num= per
=facility= per =address=, but it wasn't the case. This could be mean that
several facilities share the name (e.g. Subway or Mc Donalds)  or the
license; another explanation is that several facilities share the same
address, as the facilities at the stadium or the airport.

We will decide to use the combination of =license_num=, =facility=, =facility_aka=,
=facility_type= and =address= to identify a facility:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql

license_num, facility, facility_type, facility_aka, address , count(*)

What attributes we want to add to the =entities= table? We should add
all the attributes that describe the entity and doesn't depend on the
event. Therefore we will add =zip_code=, =location= and some data about
when this facility got their license or if this is still open. We will
add =start_time, end_time=. These columns will be important because we
won't wnat to do predictions on entities that aren't active. We will
use the following definition

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A facility is active from their opening as a businness until it closes
#+END_QUOTE

We don't have this type of date directly in our data source, so we
will use as an interval between the earliest date in the data source
and the latest date *or* the greater data in which  the *result* of the
inspection was =out of business= or =business not located=.
